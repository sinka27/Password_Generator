# Password Generator

## Description
A random password generator is a software program, that takes input from the user and based on those input criteria automatically generates a password. 

## Why do we need a Password Generator?
* The primary objective of using a generator is creation of strong and unpredictable passwords for all of your accounts.

## Problems Solved
This random password generator prompts the user for the following criteria:

* The password length should be in between 8 to 128 characters. 
* Do you want to include numbers in your password? 
* Do you want to include special characters in your password?
* Do you want to include uppercase letters in your password?
* Do you want to include lowercase letters in your password?
* Once the program has verified that the password length meets the minimum and maximum requirements, it then determines which criteria the user has selected and generates a secure password string based on the user's input. 
* The new password is then displayed in the #password textarea.
